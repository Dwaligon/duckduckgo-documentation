# Going Live

The most exciting part of hacking on an Instant Answer is launching on DuckDuckGo.com for everyone to enjoy. The search engine serves millions of queries *a day* all around the world, across hundreds of types of devices. 

As you can imagine, the community has set a few requirements in place. In this section, we'll walk you through the process of going live on DuckDuckGo.com.

Launching an Instant Answer isn't trivial, but it's very doable - and rewarding. For our part, we'll be as transparent as possible about everything you need to know.

## The Process

Once you've thought of and planned an idea that can meet the [Instant Answer Checklist](#), the steps for submission are as follows:

1. Get your idea approved [by reaching out to the community](mailto:QuackSlack@duckduckgo.com?subject=AddMe) ([or email](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com))
2. Build and test it, with the help of [walkthroughs](#) and [live examples](https://duck.co/ia)
3. [Submit a pull request](#) that meets the [Instant Answer Checklist](#)

Get started by [letting us know](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com) what you're working on. By involving us, we can provide guidance and potentially save you a lot of time and effort.

## Feedback and Support

You don't have to figure it all out on your own. We have a great community [on Slack](mailto:QuackSlack@duckduckgo.com?subject=AddMe), as well as at [Meetups](http://duckduckgo.meetup.com) around the globe. If you need help, or want to think out loud, don't hesitate to join in - we're excited to help newcomers. You can always [send an email](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com) if you prefer.

**Say hello long before your pull request.** The feedback on pull request submissions is mainly pass/fail based on the [Instant Answer Checklist](#), so it's best to have someone in the community help review your work ahead of time for detailed help and feedback.

## Maintaining Your Contribution

(Talk about our process and standards from a high level. Set the expectation of submitting an IA, reviewing, getting feedback, and maintaining long term.)

(This section should talk about regularly checking on their IA and IA page, prodding the community for feedback/improvements, and owning the query_space long term.)
