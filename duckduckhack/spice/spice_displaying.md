# Adding Your Spice to the DuckDuckGo AnswerBar

Once your Instant Answer has been triggered, and the API request has returned a response to the client, the final step is to display your results onscreen.

## Contents of the Spice Frontend Callback

The Spice frontend callback function, [covered in the Spice Basic Tutorial](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/spice_basic_tutorial#npm-spice-frontend-javascript), contains the code which displays your Spice. 

The most important part of this callback, and often the only part, is calling [`Spice.add()`](#codespiceaddcode-overview). This function is powerful and gives you a lot of control over your results' appearance, context, and user interactions.

## Available Options

The properties you can pass to the `Spice.add()` function are documented in the [Instant Answer Display Reference](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/display_reference). This document provides an in-depth overview of all that `Spice.add()` allows you to do.

In some scenarios, you may also want to handle the AnswerBar's events (for example, to stop media playing when the user hides your Instant Answer). These [events](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/display_reference#events) are covered at the end of the reference.

## Calling `Spice.add()`

The following is a code summary of how the options covered in the [Instant Answer Display Reference](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/display_reference) are passed to `Spice.add()`

```javascript
Spice.add({
