# Determine Your Instant Answer Type

The first step to planning your Instant Answer is deciding what type it is. Instant Answer type depends on how the result is obtained.

Most Instant Answers rely on some type of data source (e.g. database, text file, API) to provide their answer. Others however, are able to provide their answer through the use of pure code, like a pre-existing Perl package on CPAN or simply a script you write (e.g. a string manipulation function).

**Before you start coding, let us know your plans, and what Instant Answer type you'd like to use.** By involving us early we can provide guidance and potentially save you a lot of time and effort. Email us at [open@duckduckgo.com](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com) with what idea you're working on and how you're thinking of going about it.

The following flowchart will help you to think about what type of Instant Answer you'll be creating, which is based on your Instant Answer's data source:

If you were able to determine your Instant Answer type, then you're ready to [setup your development environment](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-documentation/blob/master/duckduckhack/getting-started/setup_dev_environment.md)!

If the right Instant Answer type is still not obvious, don't worry, the DuckDuckGo Community is here for you! Please visit our [Instant Answer Ideas Forum](https://dukgo.com/ideas) and post a new thread for your Instant Answer. Be sure to describe the Instant Answer you have in mind, and don't forget to indicate where you think the data should come from. Someone from the community or the DuckDuckGo staff will be able to help you determine the best course of action for you.
