## What are Instant Answers?

**Instant Answers present what you were seeking in zero clicks.**

Instant Answers go right at the top of DuckDuckGo's search results - above ads and even search results. They have the potential to show up on 10 million searches every day. You can browse the [full list of Instant Answers](https://duck.co/ia) and see what contributors have made.

They can be really complicated and dynamic...

...or super simple yet convenient.

Some are just cool:

Many are absolutely delightful and unexpected:

Many are super practical...

...in ways we never imagined:

Some Instant Answers are built from pure code:

Other Instant Answers channel external sources (API requests), databases, or key-value stores.

**The [possibilities are endless](https://duck.co/ideas) but the point is to provide a perfect result for every search.**

In these docs, we'll show you how to build Instant Answers that can do this and more. Let's get started with [ways to contribute](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/contributing).
