## What are Instant Answers?

**Instant Answers present what you were seeking in zero clicks.**

Instant Answers go right at the top of DuckDuckGo's search results - above all else. They have the potential to show up on 10 million searches every day.

They can be really complicated and dynamic...

...or super simple yet convenient.

Some are just funny:

Many are absolutely delightful and unexpected:

Many are super practical...

...in ways we never imagined:

Some Instant Answers are built from pure code:

Other Instant Answers channel external sources (API requests), databases, or key-value stores.

**The possibilities are endless but the point is to provide a perfect result for every search.**

In these docs, we'll show you how to build Instant Answers that can do this and more. Start by reading about [ways to contribute](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/contributing).
