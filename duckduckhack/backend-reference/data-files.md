# Data Files

Instant Answers - particularly Goodies - can use simple text files for display or processing. These files can be read once and reused to answer many queries without cluttering up your source code.

The `share` function gives each Instant Answer access to a subdirectory of the repository's [`share`](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/tree/master/share/goodie) directory. The subdirectory for your Instant Answer is based on its Perl package name which is transformed from CamelCase to underscore_separated_words. 

## Usage


The [MAC Address Goodie](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/andrey/js-keycodes-cheatsheet/lib/DDG/Goodie/MacAddress.pm) uses the `share` directory to hold data for processing purposes:

```perl
my %oui_db = share("oui_database.txt")->slurp;
```

Here the `share` function grabs the `oui_database.txt` file. The returned object's `slurp` method is called which pushes each line of the file into an array.

The full code performs some additional parsing on each line of the `slurp`-ed array:

```perl
my %oui_db = map { chomp; my (@f) = split(/\\n/, $_, 2); ($f[0] => $f[1]); } share("oui_database.txt")->slurp;
```

You may decide to take advantage of particular data formats, such as JSON, as does the [Independence Day Goodie](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/lib/DDG/Goodie/IndependenceDay.pm):

```perl
my $data = share('independence_days.json')->slurp;
$data = decode_json($data);
```

Another example involves parsing a YAML file, as does the [Paper Size Goodie](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/lib/DDG/Goodie/Paper.pm):

```perl
use YAML::XS 'LoadFile';

my $sizes = LoadFile(share('sizes.yml'));
```

## UTF-8 Encoding

One further consideration is whether your data file contains non-ASCII characters. If so, you will want to prepare the file with UTF-8 encoding.  The [Shortcut Goodie](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/lib/DDG/Goodie/Shortcut.pm) uses a UTF-8 data file:

```perl
my @shortcuts = share('shortcuts.csv')->slurp(iomode => '<:encoding(UTF-8)');
```

As with the Passphrase Goodie example above, each line becomes an entry in the resulting array. With this `iomode` set, the UTF-8 characters used to denote system-specific keys will be handled properly throughout the rest of the processing.

## Generating Data Files

In some cases, you may need to generate the data files you will `slurp` from the share directory. If so, please put the required generation scripts in the Goodie's `share` directory. While **shell scripts are preferred**, your scripts can be written in the language of your choice.

As an example, the [CurrencyIn Goodie](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/lib/DDG/Goodie/CurrencyIn.pm) uses a [combination of Shell and Python scripts](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/tree/master/share/goodie/currency_in) to generate its input data, `currency.txt`.
