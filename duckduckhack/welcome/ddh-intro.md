## Create Your Own Results

Instant Answers allow you to improve search in an area you care about. Your Instant Answer will appear above ads and search results. They have the potential to show up on [millions of searches](https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html) every day.

Instant Answers can do a lot of things. They can be quite dynamic...

...or simply convenient:

Some are just cool:

Many are absolutely delightful and unexpected:

Many are super practical...

...in ways we never imagined:

Some Instant Answers are built from pure code:

Other Instant Answers channel external sources (API requests):
